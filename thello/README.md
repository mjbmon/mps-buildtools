# A simple "Hello, world" project in C++.

This project uses Cmake along with the
mps-buildtools scripts to build a simple
"Hello, world" program. Builds and runs on
Linux/Unix, MacOS, and Windows.

# Building and running:

On Linux/Unix and MacOS:

  ./configure
  make all
  make install

On Windows:

  configure
  make all
  make install

The default install prefix is (user)/.local, but
this can be modified with ./configure --prefix another_prefix.
